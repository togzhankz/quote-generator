// 123. Write a JavaScript program to find whether the members of a given array of integers is a permutation of numbers from 1 to a given integer. 


// 124. Write a JavaScript program to create the value of NOR of two given booleans. 
// Note: In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form (p NOR q) is true precisely when neither p nor q is true - i.e. when both of p and q are false
// Sample Example:
// For x = true and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = false; For x = false and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = true.

// 128. Write a JavaScript program to find the smallest round number that is not less than a given value. 
// Note: A round number is informally considered to be an integer that ends with one or more zeros.[3] So, 590 is rounder than 592, but 590 is less round than 600.

// ...


// 132. Write a JavaScript program to find all distinct prime factors of a given integer. 


// 133. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given fraction is proper or not. 
// Note: There are two types of common fractions, proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator is less than the denominator, and improper otherwise.
